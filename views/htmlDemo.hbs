From the succulent ebi ramen to the indulgent tokatsu, the spicy kick of tantanmen to the comforting shio, each bowl is a culinary adventure. My top picks hail from Mendokoro Ramen in Manila and Yushoken in Cebu, where every slurp is a journey through the art of ramen. A testament to the endless possibilities within a single bowl, this is why ramen is a cherished, restaurant-style delight.</td>

The thrill of grilling an array of succulent meats and enjoying the interactive dining experience is unparalleled. While some cuts may be on the fatty side, the diversity of side dishes elevates the entire meal. This Korean BBQ adventure marries sizzling flavors and camaraderie, making it a cherished favorite despite its occasional indulgent excess.</td>

Crispy, golden treasures like fried chicken, mouthwatering Filipino specialties, comforting katsudon, or the delightful crunch of onion rings and fries have an irresistible charm. Their taste lingers in memory, a testament to the universal joy of savoring the indulgence of fried favorites, even if enjoyed in moderation.</td>

                    <td>Plate up is a rogue-lite restaurant management game with strategic planning. It is similar to OverCooked but gets more chaotic with each round and as the days pass. I would give this game a 10/10 since its my usual go to game when I want to play something quick
                        and de-stress from work and school. The rounds are usually short but addictive. There are endless customization and automation options for your kitchen making each play-through unique.

                    <td>Darkest Dungeon 2 II is a roguelike road trip of the damned. One can select heroes to ultimately journey to the mountain to defeat the lovecraftian horrors that reside within. I would give this game an 7.5/10 mainly because it has just released and there are still some balancing issues to be resolved within the mechanics.
                        However despite the bugs and balancing issues, this game is still fun. Each run is carries its own kind of stess and mixing up combat by composing different teams is always a blast. I am a fan of Darkest Dungeon I and am glad that the developers decided to pursue a second game in the franchise.

                    <td>Cowboy Simulator! I give this game a 10/10. I only recently started to play this game this year despite it being in my steam library for some time. This is because I know it is a time sinker and I absolutely have no self control and might play until I forgotten that I haven't eaten or slept for a day or two. This is why the play hour count is so low because I don't play often because I will get sucked into a vortex where time and space no longer exist. 10/10</td>

                    <td>Don't Starve is a wilderness and base building survival game where you struggle against the elements, starvation, manage your sanity and ensure there's always enough light. I rate this game 8.5/10 since although there is a lot of re-playability with each run, one can get easily bored when you have done everything and your base has already been built up to the extreme. 
                        Its always fun to play with friends and the different DLCs provide a nice variety to the game mechanics.
